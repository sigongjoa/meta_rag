Input Problem:
This is a more complex problem. It has an inline formula, like $E=mc^2$, and also a display formula:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$
Here is another inline formula: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
Let's also include a LaTeX environment:
\begin{equation}
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\end{equation}
This should be parsed correctly. What do you think?
